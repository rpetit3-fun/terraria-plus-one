# terraria+1

Anyone who has played the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI, is aware items that can be crafted have a normal quality and a high quality (+1) version. My thoughts with this mod are to allow items such as weapons and armor to be further upgraded. For example you could upgrade that lowly 'Wooden Sword' into a 'Wooded Sword +1'.

I will be using tModLoader for this mod and will focus on Terraria v1.3! Stay tuned!
